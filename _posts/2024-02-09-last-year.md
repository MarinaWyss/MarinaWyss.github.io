I haven't posted in a long time. But, I have definitely beeen learning.

In the last year, I've spent a lot of time working on infratructure for ML. This included using CDK to spin up and manage secure AWS infrastructure to enable ML at scale for my team.

I've also spent a lot of time working with LLMs (including more infra set up). I've built supervised models, worked on causal inference problems, and written a ton of documentation around tooling and best practices.

Teaching and mentorship has become a big focus. I've worked with several mentees 1:1 to help them build portfolios and break into the job market, worked closely with a group of Data Science students at Berkeley, and am now teaching ML at Interview Kickstart.

In the first half of this year, I'll be learning Java and refreshing algorithms and data structures in preparation for beginning a second Master's degree (this time in Computer Science at George Tech) in the Fall.

Unrelated to data and ML, I also got my personal training certification, so I'll be continuing to build on those foundations and learning more about mobility and nutrition in the coming year.
