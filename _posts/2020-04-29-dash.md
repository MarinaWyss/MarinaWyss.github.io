## How to Build an Interactive Dashboard with Plotly Dash

Throughout my final semester of my Master's program, I've been working on a large-scale web scraping and text analysis project about monitoring media coverage of the 2020 Presidential Primary Election. As part of our final project, I created my first [interactive dashboard](https://us-primary-election-news.herokuapp.com/) with Plotly Dash.

The learning curve on this one was a bit steep for someone with no HTML/CSS experience (outside of customizing my MySpace page in the early 2000s), but once I got the hang of it putting this together was a lot of fun. 

To learn more about the project, we also wrote up our findings in [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@madeline.n.brady/do-u-s-news-outlets-favor-certain-2020-presidential-candidates-4e6de7efd936).
