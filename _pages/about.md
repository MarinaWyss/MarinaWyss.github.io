Hi there. My name is Marina, and I’m a machine learning-focused Data Scientist. I did my undergrad at U.C. Berkeley, and got my Master’s at the Hertie School in Berlin, where I focused on social data science. My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marina-wyss/) has all the other details.

Data science is neat because there's so much to learn. This blog is where I’m cataloging the stuff I’m curious about, and what I learn about it.
