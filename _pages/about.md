Hi there. My name is Marina, and I’m a Junior Data Scientist living in Berlin. I did my undergrad at U.C. Berkeley, and I recently completed my Master’s program at the Hertie School, where I focused on data science courses. This blog is where I’m cataloging the stuff I’m curious about, and what I learn about it.
