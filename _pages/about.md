Hi there. My name is Marina, and I’m a Data Scientist at Coursera. I did my undergrad at U.C. Berkeley, and I recently completed my Master’s program at the Hertie School, where I focused on social data science. This blog is where I’m cataloging the stuff I’m curious about, and what I learn about it.
