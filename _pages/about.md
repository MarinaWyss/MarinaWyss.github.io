Hi there. My name is Marina, and I’m an Applied Scientist at Twitch/Amazon. 

I did my undergrad at U.C. Berkeley, and got my Master’s at the Hertie School in Berlin, where I focused on social data science. 
I've also recently begun a second Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Tech.

I spent a few years working in ML at Coursera, and now at Twitch, where I focus on building production systems in diverse domains, working with LLMs, and MLOps/infrastructure.

My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marina-wyss/) has all the other details.

This field is neat because there's so much to learn. This blog is where I’m cataloging the stuff I’m curious about, and what I learn about it.
