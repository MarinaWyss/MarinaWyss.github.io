Hi there. My name is Marina, and I’m a Junior Data Scientist living in Berlin. I did my undergrad at U.C. Berkeley, and I just completed a Master’s program at the Hertie School, where I focused on social data science courses. I’m pretty new to data science, so I’m learning a ton every day. This blog is where I’m cataloging the stuff I’m curious about, and what I learn about it.
